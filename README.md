# CNN_image_classification

Implemented VGG-13 model for image classification. The CNN model is trained to classify images into three categories: dogs, food, and vehicles. The CNN model is implemented and trained using PyTorch. The training steps includes data preprocessing, model architecture, and training and validation steps. Model architecture is implemented with dropout and regularization techniques to avoid overfitting and improve the accuracy. Users can upload an image, and the Flask web application will predict the category to which the image belongs.

Setup & Installation:

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cnn-image-classification-flask.git
cd cnn-image-classification-flask

2. Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the pre-trained model file and place it in the root directory of the project.

4. Start the flask app
python app.py

5. Open the web application and upload an image.
